abstract = {dence-informed guidance, state and local policymakers have put policies in place quickly and with little evidence to support their choices or little consideration of the potentially serious trade- offs. There is an urgent need for a comprehensive and systematic assessment of potential public health interventions to address COVID-19. In this document, we describe the interdisciplinary and multisectoral approach used to develop a tool to fill that need. The tool provides the information and context that policymakers need now to understand the effects of interventions, weigh the trade-offs between them, and decide when and how these interventions can be relaxed. The tool should be of interest to policymakers and others who wish to use it to understand the potential impacts of various nonpharmaceutical interventions (e.g., school closures, stay-at-home orders) on health and economic outcomes in their communities. This document detailing the methods that underlie the tool will be of interest to policymakers or staff members and researchers who wish to better understand and assess the structure and assumptions of the models and analyses that make up the tool.
