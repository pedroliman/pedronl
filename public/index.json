[{"authors":null,"categories":["R"],"content":"Why Arena2R\rArena Simulation is a well-known Discrete Event Simulation Software. However, if you’re a heavy user you might want to extend your analysis beyond what Arena’s Process Analyzer offers. In this tutorial, I’ll guide you through the main functions of Arena2R package.\nIf you’re not an R user, fear not! Arena2R comes with an app you can use to explore your Arena Simulation data. All you’ll have to do is to Install R and R Studio, and run two commands in your R console.\nInstallation\rYou can install arena2r from github in R with:\n# install.packages(\u0026quot;devtools\u0026quot;)\rdevtools::install_github(\u0026quot;pedroliman/arena2r\u0026quot;)\rlibrary(arena2r)\rlibrary(ggplot2)\r\rExporting Arena Report Database\rThis is a basic example which shows you how to get your Arena results quickly into R. The basic idea is to run different scenarios and save each of them to a separate csv file. (Yes, you could use Process Analyzer (PAN) to run all scenarios, but to my knowledge, there’s no way to get your data out of the PAN easily).\nFollow these steps to get Arena simulation results to R:\n\rRun your model with \\(n\\) replications. Do not change the number of replications between scenarios.\rFor each scenario, save a csv with simulation results clicking on “Tools \u0026gt; ReportDatabase \u0026gt; Export Summary Statistics to CSV File”. Use the standard options. If Arena throws an error, then you’ll have to figure out how to get your results into a csv file. Sometimes it’s necessary to save the report database as a *.mdb file before generating the csv file.\r\r\rUsing the Shiny App\rIf you’re not familiar to R, you can run this command on R Console and use the example app.\n\rrunArenaApp()\r\rAfter running this command, the app screen will pop up. You can upload your csv files and play around with the Confidence Interval and Scatter Plots.\n\rUsing the Package with an R Script\r\rOpen a new .R file, and run the following code:\r\r# Load the library:\rlibrary(arena2r)\r## Carregando pacotes exigidos: ggplot2\r## Carregando pacotes exigidos: dplyr\r## ## Attaching package: \u0026#39;dplyr\u0026#39;\r## The following objects are masked from \u0026#39;package:stats\u0026#39;:\r## ## filter, lag\r## The following objects are masked from \u0026#39;package:base\u0026#39;:\r## ## intersect, setdiff, setequal, union\r## Carregando pacotes exigidos: purrr\r## Carregando pacotes exigidos: shiny\r## Carregando pacotes exigidos: shinydashboard\r## ## Attaching package: \u0026#39;shinydashboard\u0026#39;\r## The following object is masked from \u0026#39;package:graphics\u0026#39;:\r## ## box\r## Carregando pacotes exigidos: shinyBS\r## Carregando pacotes exigidos: shinyjs\r## ## Attaching package: \u0026#39;shinyjs\u0026#39;\r## The following object is masked from \u0026#39;package:shiny\u0026#39;:\r## ## runExample\r## The following objects are masked from \u0026#39;package:methods\u0026#39;:\r## ## removeClass, show\rlibrary(ggplot2)\r# Define the path to your folder with Arena csv files. In my case, it\u0026#39;s here:\rmy_path = \u0026quot;../../../arena2r/files/Arena14/\u0026quot;\r# Then, get a tidy results data.frame out of your files!\rresults = arena2r::get_simulation_results(my_path)\rknitr::kable(head(results))\r\r\rScenario\rStatistic\rReplication\rValue\r\r\r\rSCENARIO 1\rEntity 1.NumberIn\r1\r233\r\rSCENARIO 1\rEntity 1.NumberIn\r2\r247\r\rSCENARIO 1\rEntity 1.NumberIn\r3\r239\r\rSCENARIO 1\rEntity 1.NumberIn\r4\r261\r\rSCENARIO 1\rEntity 1.NumberIn\r5\r264\r\rSCENARIO 1\rEntity 1.NumberIn\r6\r266\r\r\r\rAfter these steps, now you have a tidy data.frame with your results. Let’s get into possible visualizations. Usually, you’ll be interested in the mean confidence interval for some response variable, across scenarios.\n\r# Plot a Statistic confidence interval across scenarios for a response variable.\rarena2r::plot_confint(sim_results = results, response_variable = \u0026quot;Entity 1.NumberOut\u0026quot;)\r## Warning: Ignoring unknown parameters: mult\rNow let’s explore the relationship between two variables, across scenarios and replications:\n\r# Now let\u0026#39;s plot analyse the relationship between two variables:\rarena2r::plot_scatter(sim_results = results, x_variable = \u0026quot;Entity 1.NumberIn\u0026quot;, y_variable = \u0026quot;Entity 1.NumberOut\u0026quot;)\rNow let’s go a bit deeper and leverage ggplot2 to create a plot faceted by Scenario:\n\r# If you use ggplot and you want to get more customized plots, I suggest you to spread your data.frame:\rwide_results = results %\u0026gt;%\rtidyr::spread(Statistic, Value)\r# Recreating my plot with ggplot, now loking at Resource Utilization:\rp = ggplot(data = wide_results, mapping = aes(x = `Resource 1.Utilization`, y = `Entity 1.NumberOut`, color = Scenario)) + geom_point() + facet_wrap(~Scenario)\rp\rFinally, let’s summarise every statistic across all scenarios.\n\rstatistics_summary = arena2r::get_statistics_summary(sim_results = results, confidence = 0.95)\rknitr::kable(head(statistics_summary[,1:6]))\r\r\rScenario\rStatistic\rMean\rMedian\rLowerLimit\rUpperLimit\r\r\r\rSCENARIO 1\rEntity 1.NumberIn\r241.03333\r238.000000\r235.143546\r246.92312\r\rSCENARIO 1\rEntity 1.NumberOut\r225.13333\r226.000000\r222.244712\r228.02195\r\rSCENARIO 1\rEntity 1.NVATime\r0.00000\r0.000000\r0.000000\r0.00000\r\rSCENARIO 1\rEntity 1.OtherTime\r0.00000\r0.000000\r0.000000\r0.00000\r\rSCENARIO 1\rEntity 1.TotalTime\r11.15272\r9.730454\r9.341412\r12.96402\r\rSCENARIO 1\rEntity 1.TranTime\r0.00000\r0.000000\r0.000000\r0.00000\r\r\r\rI hope you enjoyed the package.
