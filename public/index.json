Yet, its prospected impact on Production Systems and Operations Strategy is controversial. This article contributes to this debate by examining and summarizing the prospected impact of Additive Manufacturing on Production Systems, in the light of the Competitive Dimensions through a Systematic Literature Review. In particular, this paper organises this debate by highlighting the specific impacts prospected by the literature for each competitive dimension.","tags":[],"title":"The Impacts of Additive Manufacturing on Production Systems","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Arena2R is an R package for Arena Simulation users.
