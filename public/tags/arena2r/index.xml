      <description>Teaching to seasoned managers in MBE classes is challenging. While itâ€™s important to bring new thoughts and ideas, it is necessary to provide a fundamental theo basis for experienced people with diverse backgrounds. One of the strategies I found to overcome these obstacles this week was to use a new analysis framework (in my case, Factory Physics concepts) to challenge their views about existing frames they already master. Using a combination of concepts, simulation sodels, many-objective tradeoffs visuals (like the gif below) and tasks was great to challenge their intuition about manufacturing systems.</description>
