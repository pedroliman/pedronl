      <description>You spent long hours building and refining your simulation model (eg.: a Discrete Event Model). Hopefully, you are confident that it can yield reliable results. Now itâ€™s time to use the model and draw conclusions and recomendations. At this point, you are probably out of time, the project has been delayed by many rounds of data collection and validation. After running a few scenarios the night before the final presentation, you reach the conclusion that it is going to be hard to explain to your client that the results are highly non-linear and maybe counter-intuitive.</description>
