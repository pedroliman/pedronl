      <description>In my last post, I used low-order polynomial regression to make sense of non-linear simulation model results. In this post, I’ll demonstrate how you can use splines to summarise results from an Arena simulation model.
Why Splines?In the previous post, I briefly described the motivation for using metamodels to approximate simulation models results. Splines are among the useful techinques for metamodeling because: (i) they are relatively simple (they are piecewise-defined polynomials); (ii) Unlike low-order polynomials, you can generally use them with a global sampling strategy [@Barton2006].</description>

      <description>This is part 1 of a series of posts in which I will explore the utility of using metamodels to make sense of (and possibly optimizing) simulation models.
If you used simulation modeling on a real project, you might be familiar with this fictional story:
You spent long hours building and refining your simulation model (eg.: a Discrete Event Model). Hopefully, you are confident that it can yield reliable results.</description>
