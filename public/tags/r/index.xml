      <description>Flow Benchmarking is an absolute benchmarking technique that allows one to visualize the performance limits of a manufacturing system in terms of Work in Process, Throughput and Cycle Time. This technique has been introduced in the award-winning Factory Physics (FP) Book (Hopp and Spearman 2008), and is a key component of the science-based manufacturing management approach described in (Pound, Bell, and Spearman 2014). This post will use R to allow one to quickly run this analysis using the Basic Factory Dynamics equations found in the original FP books.</description>

      <title>Discrete Event Simulation (DES) Metamodeling - Splines with R and Arena</title>

      <description>Simulation Metamodeling - building and using surrogate models that can approximate results from more complicated simulation models - is an interesting approach to analyze results from complicated, computationally expensive simulation models. Metamodels are useful because they can yield good approximations of the original simulation model response variables using less computational resources. For an introduction to Metamodeling, refer to (Barton 2015).
To my knowledge, no Discrete-Event Simulation (DES) software provides metamodeling capabilities, and guidance on how to actually execute metamodeling is scarce.</description>

      <description>This is part 1 of a series of posts in which I will explore the utility of using metamodels to make sense of (and possibly optimizing) simulation models.
If you used simulation modeling on a real project, you might be familiar with this fictional story:
You spent long hours building and refining your simulation model (eg.: a Discrete Event Model). Hopefully, you are confident that it can yield reliable results.</description>
