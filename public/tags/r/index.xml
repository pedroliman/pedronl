      <description>Trying SplinesOur quadtratic model might be “good enough” to this application
I simulated all scenarios and saved their results as separate csv files. You can download the files here.

      <description>This is part 1 of a series of posts in which I will explore the utility of using metamodels to make sense of (and possibly optimizing) simulation models.
If you used simulation modeling on a real project, you might be familiar with this fictional story:
You spent long hours building and refining your simulation model (eg.: a Discrete Event Model). Hopefully, you are confident that it can yield reliable results.</description>
