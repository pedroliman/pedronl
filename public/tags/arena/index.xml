      <description>Flow Benchmarking is an absolute benchmarking technique that allows one to compare the current performance of a manufacturing system against its performance limits in terms of Work in Process, Throughput and Cycle Time. The technique has been introduced in the award-winning Factory Physics (FP) Book (Hopp and Spearman 2008), and is a key component of the science-based manufacturing management approach described in (Pound, Bell, and Spearman 2014). This post will use R to allow one to quickly run this analysis using the Basic Factory Dynamics equations found in the original FP books.</description>
