      <description>Factory Physics (FP) Flow Benchmarking is a technique useful to perform absolute benchmark of a system’s throughput and cycle time, given the Work in Process (wip) the system is allowed to have. These techniques are introduced in (Pound, Bell, and Spearman 2014) and (Hopp and Spearman 2008), and repeating this discussion is beyond the scope of this post.
As a simulation pratictioneer and lecturer, as I read these books, I naturally started creating models and spreadsheet formulas to verify if the theory holds (and, of course, it does).</description>

      <description>This is part 1 of a series of posts in which I will explore the utility of using metamodels to make sense of (and possibly optimizing) simulation models.
If you used simulation modeling on a real project, you might be familiar with this fictional story:
You spent long hours building and refining your simulation model (eg.: a Discrete Event Model). Hopefully, you are confident that it can yield reliable results.</description>
