      <description>Flow Benchmarking is an absolute benchmarking technique that allows one to visualize the performance limits of a manufacturing system in terms of Work in Process, Throughput and Cycle Time. This technique has been introduced in the award-winning Factory Physics (FP) Book (Hopp and Spearman 2008), and is a key component of the science-based manufacturing management approach described in (Pound, Bell, and Spearman 2014). This post will use R to allow one to quickly run this analysis using the Basic Factory Dynamics equations found in the original FP books.</description>

      <description>This is part 1 of a series of posts in which I will explore the utility of using metamodels to make sense of (and possibly optimizing) simulation models.
If you used simulation modeling on a real project, you might be familiar with this fictional story:
You spent long hours building and refining your simulation model (eg.: a Discrete Event Model). Hopefully, you are confident that it can yield reliable results.</description>
