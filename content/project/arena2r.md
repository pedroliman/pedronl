[Arena2R](http://arena2r.pedronl.com) is an R package for Arena Simulation users. [Arena Simulation](https://arenasimulation.com) is a great discrete event simulation software, but it lacks neat plots and data reporting tools. After spending a considerable ammount of time struggling with arena output files, I've decided to write a few functions, which  evolved into this package. You can use the package either via it's accompanying app, or build your own R script and work from there.
