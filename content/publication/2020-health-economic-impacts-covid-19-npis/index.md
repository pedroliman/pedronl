abstract: With the rapid spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and in the absence of evidence-informed guidance, state and local policymakers have had to put policies in place quickly, with little evidence to support their choices, and with little consideration as to the potentially serious trade-offs that such policies could introduce. Thus, there is an urgent need for a comprehensive and systematic assessment of potential public health interventions to address COVID-19 and when to relax them. This document describes the interdisciplinary and multisectoral approach that RAND researchers used to develop the COVID-19 Decision Support Tool, which is designed to fill that need.
