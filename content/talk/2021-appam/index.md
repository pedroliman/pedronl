title: Policy Responses to the COVID-19 Pandemic
abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted many aspects of life, and several policies have been implemented to lessen the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. This session will present papers that evaluate the impacts of these policies. The first paper uses epidemiological and economic models employing the Robust Decision Making (RDM) approach to evaluate the types of policies that are likely to have the largest reductions in COVID-19 transmission. The second paper evaluates the impact of COVID mitigation policies on race/ethnicity disparities. The third paper examines whether the Supplemental Nutrition and Assistance Program (SNAP) and Medicaid interacted to protect against the onset of food, economic, and psychological hardships attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic. The final paper estimate the effect of school reopening policies on COVID-19 transmission. The papers presented in this session further the understanding of the impacts of policies designed to reduce the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.
