# About

Hi! Welcome to my blog! I’m an Assistant Policy Researcher at [RAND](https://rand.org) and a Ph.D. candidate at [Pardee RAND Graduate School](https://www.prgs.edu/). You will find updated information about my professional background and my RAND-related work at my RAND profile. My interest in R started in 2013 when I was first introduced to it by a professor. Since then, I’ve been using R for virtually everything. From statistical/ML applications to simulation packages (e.g., [Arena2R](/post/arena2r-package-tutorial/)), to modeling [competition within the 3D printing industry](/post/3d-printing-rdm-analysis-2018-dmdu-meeting/), R has been my go-to language. In this blog, you will find some R code and tech/R/analytics-related posts that I would like to share with the R community and are not appropriate for a paper. If you find any of this helpful and would like to [connect](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pedro-nascimento-de-lima/), [let me know](mailto:pedrolima.n@gmail.com)!

My academic interests often gravitate tow1ards the intersection between OR, Programming, and Management of Wicked Problems. My [undergraduate](files/Pedro-Lima-Undergrad-Dissertation-PSMs.pdf) and [master's](files/Pedro-Lima-MS-Dissertation-RDM-AM.pdf) dissertations focused on wicked problems and decision under deep uncertainty, have received the Best Brazilian Dissertation in Production Engineering Prize from ABEPRO, in [2016](http://www.unisinos.br/fique-sabendo/escola-politecnica/engenharia-de-producao/aluno-e-premiado-pela-abepro-2016/) and [2018](http://www.unisinos.br/noticias/universidade/gmap-unisinos-em-destaque), respectively.
