# About

Hi! Welcome to my R blog! Im an Assistant Policy Researcher at [RAND](https://rand.org) and a Ph.D. candidate at [Pardee RAND Graduate School](https://www.prgs.edu/). You can find more information about my RAND-related work at my [RAND profile](https://www.rand.org/about/people/l/lima_pedro.html).

My interest in R started in 2013 when I was first introduced to it by a professor. Since then, I've been using R for everything, from the most commom statistical/ML applications to building simulation packages (e.g.: [Arena2R](/post/arena2r-package-tutorial/)), crunching thousands of time-series available from web apis, modeling raiway systems, and modeling [competition within the 3D printing industry](/post/3d-printing-rdm-analysis-2018-dmdu-meeting/).

<!---

My academic interests often gravitate tow1ards the intersection between OR, Programming, and Management of Wicked Problems. My [undergraduate](files/Pedro-Lima-Undergrad-Dissertation-PSMs.pdf) and [master's](files/Pedro-Lima-MS-Dissertation-RDM-AM.pdf) dissertations focused on wicked problems and decision under deep uncertainty, have received the Best Brazilian Dissertation in Production Engineering Prize from ABEPRO, in [2016](http://www.unisinos.br/fique-sabendo/escola-politecnica/engenharia-de-producao/aluno-e-premiado-pela-abepro-2016/) and [2018](http://www.unisinos.br/noticias/universidade/gmap-unisinos-em-destaque), respectively.
