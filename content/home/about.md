# About Me

I am a doctoral candidate at [Pardee RAND Graduate School](https://www.prgs.edu/). Pardee RAND is a Policy Analysis graduate school situated within the [RAND Corporation](https://rand.org), a non-profit institution with the bold mission of [improving policy and decision making through research and analysis](https://www.rand.org/about/history.html). You will be able to find more about my RAND-related work at RAND's website in the future.

Prior to RAND, I was a Lecturer at [UNISINOS University](http://www.unisinos.br/global/en/), southern Brazil, where I taught Operational Research and Simulation Modeling on undergraduate courses. I was also a member of the [GMAP | UNISINOS Research Group](http://gmap.unisinos.br), where I worked building decision support tools, mostly with R. My interest in R started in 2013 when I was first introduced to it by a professor. Since then, I've been using R for everything, from the most commom statistical/ML applications to building simulation packages, crunching thousands of time-series available from web apis, modeling raiway systems and competition within the 3D printing industry.

My academic interests often gravitate tow1ards the intersection between OR, Programming, and Management of Wicked Problems. My [undergraduate](files/Pedro-Lima-Undergrad-Dissertation-PSMs.pdf) and [master's](files/Pedro-Lima-MS-Dissertation-RDM-AM.pdf) dissertations focused on wicked problems and decision under deep uncertainty, have received the Best Brazilian Dissertation in Production Engineering Prize from ABEPRO, in [2016](http://www.unisinos.br/fique-sabendo/escola-politecnica/engenharia-de-producao/aluno-e-premiado-pela-abepro-2016/) and [2018](http://www.unisinos.br/noticias/universidade/gmap-unisinos-em-destaque), respectively.
