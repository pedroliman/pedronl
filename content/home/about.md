# Biography

I am a Lecturer at [UNISINOS University](http://www.unisinos.br/global/en/), southern Brazil, where I teach Operational Research and Simulation Modeling to undergraduate courses. I am also a member of the [GMAP Research Group](http://gmap.unisinos.br), where I work building decision support tools. 

My academic interests often gravitate towards the intersection between OR, Programming and Management of Wicked Problems. My [undergraduate](files/Pedro-Lima-Undergrad-Dissertation-PSMs.pdf) and [master's](files/Pedro-Lima-MS-Dissertation-RDM-AM.pdf) dissertations focused on wicked problems and decision under deep uncertainty, have received the Best Brazilian Dissertation in Production Engineering Prize from ABEPRO, in [2016](http://www.unisinos.br/fique-sabendo/escola-politecnica/engenharia-de-producao/aluno-e-premiado-pela-abepro-2016/) and [2018](http://www.unisinos.br/noticias/universidade/gmap-unisinos-em-destaque), respectively.
