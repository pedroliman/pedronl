This is a non-exaustive list of resources that I find useful for learning.

[R-Bloggers](https://www.r-bloggers.com/): Subscribe to the R-bloggers website to get updates from thousands of R blogs like this.

[R Weekly](https://rweekly.org/): Another R mailing list.

[Data Camp](https://www.datacamp.com): My favourite resource for learning R and python.

[Water Programming Blog](https://waterprogramming.wordpress.com): Great resource for python and R tutorials (even if you do not work on the Water Resources Management field).

[DMDU Society](http://deepuncertainty.org): The Society for Decision Making Under Deep Uncertainty is a great resource for those interested in simulation-based decision making. Check out the materials from previous meetings!
