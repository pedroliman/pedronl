I am an assistant policy researcher at [RAND](https://rand.org), a Ph.D. candidate at the [Pardee RAND Graduate School](https://www.prgs.edu/) and a visiting graduate student at [Argonne National Laboratory](https://anl.gov). I hold a B.S. and an M.S. in production engineering from UNISINOS University in Brazil and an M.Phil in Policy Analysis from Pardee RAND.

Prior to joining RAND, I was a lecturer at UNISINOS, Brazil, where I taught simulation modeling and other quantitative courses. In this page, you will find links to recent publications, links to presentation recordings, links to tools and software I helped to build and (occasional) blog posts. You will find up-to-date information on my RAND work at my [RAND profile](https://www.rand.org/about/people/l/lima_pedro_nascimento_de.html) page.
