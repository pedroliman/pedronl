I am an assistant policy researcher at [RAND Corporation](https://www.rand.org/about/people/l/lima_pedro_nascimento_de.html), a Ph.D. candidate at [Pardee RAND Graduate School](https://www.prgs.edu/), an Adjunct Instructor at [USC Sol Price School of Public Policy](http://priceschool.usc.edu/), and a visiting graduate student at [Argonne National Laboratory](https://anl.gov).

My <u>[research](#publications)</u> uses modeling to inform health policy. Most of my recent work focused on pressing COVID-19 policy questions. My work <u>[generated recommendations](/publication/2021-reopening-under-uncertainty-stress-testing-california-covid-19-exit-strategy/)</u> for crafting COVID-19 reopening plans, based on a <u>[stress-test of COVID-19 reopening strategies](/publication/2021-reopening-california-robust-decision-making/)</u>. I also helped build <u>[RAND's COVID-19 Policy Tool](https://www.rand.org/pubs/tools/TLA173-1.html)</u>, which became <u>[RAND's most popular research of 2020](https://www.rand.org/blog/2020/12/the-most-popular-rand-research-of-2020.html)</u>. I am passionate about tackling complex and deeply uncertain policy questions with modeling and computing.

I also teach statistics at USC Sol Price School of Public Policy. Prior to coming to the US, I was a lecturer at UNISINOS, where I taught simulation modeling and other courses in engineering and management programs. 

Here you will find links to my <u>[recent publications](#publications)</u>, <u>[tools and software](#projects)</u> I helped to build and more. If you find any of this interesting and want to connect, <u>[follow me on twitter](https://twitter.com/pedrolima_n)</u> or <u>[get in touch](#contact)</u>!
